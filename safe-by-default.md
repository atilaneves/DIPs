## Rationale

While `@safe` makes it possible to write memory-safe code in D and
have the compiler verify that this is indeed the case, having it be
opt-in makes it hard to use in practice. Third-party libraries in
particular, Phobos included, will limit the usage of `@safe` unless an
effort is made to make their code callable from `@safe` functions.

Most D functions are `@safe` in practice, however, and defaults
matter.  Making `@safe` be the default will enable more D code to be
verifiably memory-safe. Given that most functions are effectively
`@safe`, implementing this DIP will also reduce the number of
necessary annotations in D code.

## Prior Work

[DIP1028](https://github.com/atilaneves/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/rejected/DIP1028.md).

[A previous draft proposal](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/pull/153).

## Description

Currently functions whose attributes are not inferred and that do not
have an explicit `@safe`/`@trusted`/`@system` attribute are assumed to
be `@system`. This DIP proposes that the default become `@safe`. Since
this is a breaking change it will be gated by the
`-preview=safedefault` compiler switch.

This DIP makes no distinction between `extern(D)`, `extern(C)`, and
`extern(C++)` functions. Although the latter two *usually* apply to
functions written in C or C++ respectively, that is not necessarily
the case. Callback functions can be implemented in D, and thereby
correctly proven to be `@safe` by the compiler. The `extern`
declarations only affect mangling and calling convention, and not what
programming language they were written in.

This DIP does however make a distinction between declarations and
definitions; the latter refers to the case when the function's body is
visible to the compiler. In this case, `@safe` will be the default.
If there is no body, the compiler cannot verify the `@safe`ty of the
function and in those cases this DIP proposes that there will be no
default. All declarations (i.e. functions with no body) must have
exactly one of the `@safe`/`@trusted`/`@system` annotations or the
module that contains them will fail to compile. This will handle the
common case of declaring functions that are implemented in another
language.


## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

This will likely break a lot of code that was not previously annotated
since `@safe` functions have restrictions that do not apply to
`@system` functions. Functions that use features not allowed in
`@safe` functions such as taking the address of a local will no longer
compile. Virtual functions that override a function that is now
`@safe` will not be able to be `@system`.
