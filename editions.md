## Abstract

written.

## Rationale

Although D was written as a language that had learned the mistakes
made by other languages, it of course ended up making a few of its
own. There are many things that we would like to change about the
language but are not allowed to given the likelihood, or in some cases
the certainty, that existing code will no longer compiler. Worse still
is code that compiles under the new language rules but that behaves
differently.

In order to not be limited by the decisions of the past and only be
able to make additive changes to the language, this document proposes
a mechanism to make breaking changes that would only apply to code
that *has not yet been written*. In this way the language can evolve
and become simpler while catering to the existing D codebases out
there.


## Prior Work

[Rust editions](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2052-epochs.html).
[Epochs in C++](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1881r0.html).


## Description

A D *edition* is a set of changes to the D programming language
defined by its leadership. These changes are allowed to be breaking
changes in the sense that they would, if applied, be able to cause
existing D code that compiles to no longer do so, or change its
semantics should it still compile. In order to be able to try out
individual changes that make up an edition, each one of them would be
implemented already and gated behind a `-preview=` flag in the
compiler. After giving these changes time to mature, an edition would
be defined as a set of approved preview flags that have proven
themselves to be useful.

Editions would be opt-in, which would guarantee that no existing code
can break unless a programmer explicitly attempts to migrate it to a
new edition. The mechanism proposed to do so would be when declaring
a module; this way existing codebases can be migrated one module at
at time.

This DIP proposes that D modules be able to optionally declare a D
edition that they target. Existing modules without this optional
declaration are considered to target the current original edition.
That is: they will be compiled as if the editions feature did not
exist.

Modules that opt-in to an edition will be compiled as if the compiler
had been invoked with the set of preview flags of the edition.

Opting in to an edition is part of the module declaration:

```Grammar
ModuleDeclaration:
    ModuleAttributes(opt) module ModuleFullyQualifiedName Edition;
Edition:
    Identifier
```

This DIP proposes that editions can only be officially released,
i.e. finalised, when druntime and phobos can be transitioned to it.

The feature is meant to be backwards and forwards compatible: D
modules of different editions should be able to import each other.
Templates would obey the rules of the edition of the module they
are defined in, not the module where they are instantiated.

What could editions do?

### Deleting existing features

This would be the easiest change that could be made in D editions,
since it would forbid D code written in the future from using features
considered to be deprecated and, besides keeping the frontend code
for those features, has zero impact.

### Adding new features

Editions are not necessary for adding new features that do not
interact with existing ones. This document does not propose excluding
prior editions and in fact encourages said features to be back ported
to them where possible.

### Changing defaults

Defaults matter since they encourage and nudge behaviour. Newer editions
could change defaults such as `@system`/`@safe` and others.

### Changing semantics

An edition could make it so that:

```d
shared int it;
i += 5;
```

would be lowered to:

```d
shared int i;
i.atomicOp!"+="(1);
```

## Examples

The following are examples of what editions could achieve, but this
DIP is not arguing for or against any one of them.

### `@safe` by default

There was an [attempt]() to make `@safe` the default that failed. It
is likely that problems would have been found in its implementation
had it succeeded, since all current D code assumes that `@system` is
the default unless inferred. Making this change in an edition would
side-step that issue.

### `private` by default

### No exceptions

### No more `lazy`

### No more `alias this`

### Change class ABI (monitor) and/or hierarchy


### Drawbacks

While this feature will simplify D code yet to be written, it will
make the compiler more complicated by having to be able to deal with
every different edition of the language. One possibly way to bound
this complexity could be to only support the last N editions, for
N < 5.


## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

The editions feature is explicitly designed with the goal of not
introducing any breaking changes or deprecations. Existing D code that
does not opt-in will continue to compile as behave as before.

Opting in however, can make the code no longer compile, and that is a
choice to be made by the programmer in question. It is hoped that tooling
can be written to aid in this process.
